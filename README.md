## Technologies

## On the Front End

After using a lot of programing tecnologies, we need an Ui framework, or doing from cero, I decided the first and search for something compatible with react.

Material design was my first option, but, I didn't find a stable framework... I found a bootstrap version from React that looks good, but it's from another school, for a momento I try a simple and different framework: Belle, but was too simple. Finally I returned for my first option with an specific Ui library that looks enough for me, materialize.
