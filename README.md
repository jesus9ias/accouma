An Account Manager system for personal finances

## Motivation

Accouma is a new system for taking control of your personal finances. Of course, it is not the first but, why not? Personaly I has five year administrating my accounts on a simple excel sheet, after that I decided to create a system for that.

## Technologies

  - Node.js
  - React.js
  - Less
  - Redux
  - Laravel
  - MySql

## On the Front End

After using a lot of programing tecnologies, we need a Ui framework, or doing from cero, I decided the first and search for something compatible with react.

Material design, but, I didn't find and stable framwork... bootstrap is ok, but it's from another school, so I prefered an UI framework, simple and different: Belle.
